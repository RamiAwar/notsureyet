- When writing tests, make sure each test has a single responsibility. Don't cram multiple tests into one.
- The test name should be very descriptive: if it fails, we should know exactly what went wrong from the name.
- You can use pytest fixtures if needed in case there is a lot of duplication - don't create N tests if you can create 1 parametrized test instead.
- Helpful commands for testing: `uv run pytest -v`
- Check coverage when writing tests to see what's missing.
